This DojoTimer is as simple as it gets. It becomes red when tests aren't passing.

##Developing

Clone. Build.

###Build on Windows

Run ```build.cmd```

###Build on Linux

Run ```xbuild build.xml```

You probably will have to install the most complete Mono version to do that. 
Or at least the development packages and gtksharp-2.0.
